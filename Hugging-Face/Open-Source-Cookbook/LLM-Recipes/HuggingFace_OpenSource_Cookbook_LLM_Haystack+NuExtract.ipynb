The third-generation Panda debuted at the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2011, was designed at Fiat Centro Stilo under the direction of Roberto Giolito and remains in production in Italy at Pomigliano d'Arco.[1] The fourth-generation Panda is marketed as Grande Panda, to differentiate it with the third-generation that is sold alongside it. Developed under Stellantis, the Grande Panda is produced in Serbia.\n","\n","In 40 years, Panda production has reached over 7.8 million,[2] of those, approximately 4.5 million were the first generation.[3] In early 2020, its 23-year production was counted as the twenty-ninth most long-lived single generation car in history by Autocar.[4] During its initial design phase, Italdesign referred to the car as il Zero. Fiat later proposed the name Rustica.
