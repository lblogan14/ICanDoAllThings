    "2. **`MERGE (m:Movie {id:row.movieId})`**:\n",

    "3. **`SET m.released = date(row.released), m.title = row.title, m.imdbRating = toFloat(row.imdbRating)`**:\n",

    "\n",
    "4. **`FOREACH (director in split(row.director, '|') | ...)`**:\n",
    "   - Iterates through a list of directors (assumes multiple directors are separated by `|` in the CSV).\n",
    "   - For each director:\n",
    "     - Creates a `Person` node with the name of the director if it doesn’t exist, then creates a `DIRECTED` relationship between that person and the movie.\n",

    "5. **`FOREACH (actor in split(row.actors, '|') | ...)`**:\n",
    "   - Similarly, iterates through actors, creating a `Person` node for each and establishing an `ACTED_IN` relationship with the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`FOREACH (genre in split(row.genres, '|') | ...)`**:\n",
