    "In previous section, we have learned how to create POST requests in FastAPI using query parameters and scalar values. The `submit_shipment` function demonstrated how to handle POST requests with scalar values. We can test this endpoint by typing the values in the Query Parameters section of the Swagger UI, or we can use the URL directly in the browser with the parameters appended:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "http://localhost:8000/shipment?content=sofa&weight=15.5\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will send a POST request to the `/shipment` endpoint with the `content` set to \"sofa\" and the `weight` set to 15.5. The `?` indicates the start of the query parameters in the URL, and the `&` is used to separate multiple parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also send data in the request body instead of using query parameters. This is particularly useful when dealing with more complex data structures or larger amounts of data. To achieve this, we can see there is the `Body` section in the Swagger UI for the `/shipment` POST endpoint (*not available for GET requests*). Here, we can input the data in JSON format.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"content\": \"sofa\",\n",
    "  \"weight\": 15.5\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Other formats such as XML or form data can also be used, but JSON is the most common format for APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, after making this change, we may encounter an error when trying to test the endpoint. This is because FastAPI needs to know how to parse the incoming JSON data into the appropriate Python data types. Currently , the `submit_shipment` function is expecting scalar values for `content` and `weight`, but we are sending a JSON object in the request body:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.post(\"/shipment\")\n",
    "def submit_shipment(content: str, weight: float) -> dict[str, int]:\n",
    "    if weight > 25:\n",
    "        raise HTTPException(\n",
    "            status_code=status.HTTP_406_NOT_ACCEPTABLE,\n",
    "            detail=\"Maximum weight limit is 25 units.\"\n",
    "        )\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Find the next available ID\n",
    "    new_id = max(shipments.keys()) + 1\n",
    "    # Create a new shipment entry\n",
    "    shipments[new_id] = {\n",
